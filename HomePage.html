    <h3>The Purpsoe of this website was to show these films where they are fully engrossed into a world where AI becomes a friend, a lover, a killer, and a soldier. <br>
    This gives us the idea on what AI could become and can truly show how it can affect our lives in both good and bad ways. </h3>
